# TL:DR
Here we characterize the performance of the adaptive estimation scheme for the frequency estimation of low-frequency components of 1/f noise. To gauge the error in estimating the low-frequency component, we use the MSE between the estimated frequency and the temporally averaged true frequency. The averaging is done by performing the running average of the field with a finite window, which aims at getting rid of the spurious error related to high-frequency fluctuations.
